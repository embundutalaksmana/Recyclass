Beyond its usage in the food industry, PET can also be drawn into thin yarns and fibers to make polyester fabric: a fabric popular for drying quickly and wrinkle-resistant.Considering these benefits, it should be no surprise that PET production worldwide is the busiest it has ever been, reaching 30+ million metric tons annually. Plus, production is still growing at a rate of 4.2% per year.What\u2019s worrying is that although it\u2019s fully recyclable, only 27.1% of PET plastic gets recycled in the United States. That is a minuscule number considering the recycling rates of other countries, such as 97% in Norway and 75% in Canada. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs PET (Plastic #1) recyclable? \n\n\n\nPET plastic (plastic #1) is 100% recyclable and has one of the highest plastic recycling values, as it can be melted, cooled, and reheated multiple times. While recyclable, experts advise against reusing plastic #1, so prioritize reducing and recycling your plastic #1 rather than reusing it.Recycling post-consumer PET waste back into plastic pellets and then into new products involves one of two processes: physical recycling or chemical recycling.In the case of physical recycling, the PET is melted and formed into pellets or flakes. Chemical recycling of PET, on the other hand, reverses the chemical PET production process to break the waste down into individual monomers.The further nuances of the post-consumer PET recycling processes are beyond the scope of this article. But if you\u2019d like to learn more, refer to the following academic articles that cover the topic in-depth:Awaja, F., & Pavel, D. (2005). Recycling of PET.Sinha, V., Patel, M. R., & Patel, J. V. (2010). PET waste management by chemical recycling: a review.Bartolome, L., Imran, M., Cho, B. G., Al-Masry, W. A., & Kim, D. H. (2012). Recent developments in the chemical recycling of PET.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can you recycle PET (Plastic #1)? \n\n\n\nPET plastic (plastic #1) can be recycled curbside if your municipality provides this service, taken to a local recycling center, or redeemed for cash at bottle bill depots in countries and states with container deposit laws.Here\u2019s a quick rundown of each option:Curbside recycling. If your municipality provides this service, PET plastic bottles and containers can be recycled through most curbside recycling programs. All you have to do is place them in the designated bin, and your city will take care of the rest.Local recycling centers. If you don\u2019t have access to curbside recycling, you can also take PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging to a local recycling center. To find the nearest one to you, search \u201cplastic recycling center near me\u201d on Google Maps.Bottle bill depots. Also called bottle refunds, bottle deposits, or deposit refund schemes, this PET bottle recycling system exists in many states and countries. It allows you to earn back a small deposit for every bottle you recycle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to recycle PET (Plastic #1) \n\n\n\nFollow these steps to recycle PET (plastic #1):Collect all your plastic.Sort out the non-recyclable plastic.Rinse and clean any leftover food or dirt.Drop off your PET bottles at a depot.Recycle the rest of the plastic. \n\n\n\nCollect all your plastic. \n\n\n\nThe first step of recycling PET involves collecting any plastic you use in your home. To get started, get\u00a0some recycling containers. That\u2019s it. Ideally, at least two: one for curbside recyclable plastics (PET, HDPE, and PP) and another for non-recyclable plastics (PVC, LDPE, PS, and All Other Plastics).Plastic items made from PET include:Water and soda bottlesFood containersJarsMicrowave traysIn addition to the items on the list above, any other plastic items with the #1 recycling symbol are made of PET.Here\u2019s what the PET recycling symbol looks like: \n\n\n\n\n PET (Plastic #1) Recycling Symbol / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\nRecycling regularly will eventually grant you the superpower of identifying PET plastic quickly without having to look up the symbol. Initially, though, it will be easier for you to collect all plastic, regardless of type. Then, you can identify the PET plastic in the filtering and sorting phase. In any case, it\u2019s best practice to recycle all possible types of plastic, not just PET. \n\n\n\nSort out the non-recyclable plastic. \n\n\n\nOnce you have collected enough plastic around your home, it\u2019s time to move on to the filtering phase. This is where you identify the different types of plastic and separate them into distinct groups. The most straightforward way to do this is by using the recycling symbol (the resin identification code) on each plastic item and sorting them accordingly.\nThe different types of plastic are listed below:\n\nPET (Plastic #1): Curbside recyclable\nHDPE (Plastic #2): Curbside recyclable\nPVC (Plastic #3): Not curbside recyclable\nLDPE (Plastic #4): Not curbside recyclable\nPP (Plastic #5): Curbside recyclable\nPS (Plastic #6): Not curbside recyclable\nPlastic #7 (All Other Plastics): Not curbside recyclable\n\nBased on this list, filter the plastics into two groups: curbside recyclable (plastics #1, #2, and #5), and not curbside recyclable (plastics #3, #4, #6, and #7). The first group will be easy to recycle curbside, while the second group will require more effort. That is why it\u2019s important to group them separately.\nIf you have a container deposit law in your state or country, consider creating a third sorting group for PET bottles. This will allow you to quickly take all bottles to a bottle refund depot and recycle them in one go. \n\n\n\nRinse and clean any leftover food or dirt. \n\n\n\nOnce you have determined which plastics are recyclable, it\u2019s time to give them a quick rinse to ensure that they get processed by the recycling center. Remember to use water conservatively to avoid contributing to\u00a0water scarcity. The plastics don\u2019t need to be squeaky clean. Empty the container, give it a quick rinse, and that should do the trick. \n\n\n\nDrop off your PET bottles at a depot. \n\n\n\nNow\u2019s the time to take your PET bottles to a bottle refund depot to get some cash back while also helping the environment. However, if there are no deposit refund laws in your state or country, you will have to skip this step and recycle the PET bottles with your other recyclable plastics.If you\u2019re unsure about container deposit legislation in your country, have a look at these two resources, which give a country-by-country, state-by-state overview of container deposit schemes around the world:\u201cContainer-deposit legislation\u201d by Wikipedia\u201cGlobal Deposit Book\u201d by the Reloop PlatformContainer deposit legislation is one of the most effective ways of increasing PET recycling rates. So, if you live in a country or state without such a scheme, make your voice heard by contacting your local representatives and asking them to introduce a container deposit law. \n\n\n\nRecycle the rest of the plastic. \n\n\n\nAfter your PET plastic is dealt with, it\u2019s time to focus on the other plastics you collected. If you sorted your plastics properly in the previous steps, you should have a pile of recyclable plastics by now, and all that\u2019s left is to take them to the closest recycling center, and you\u2019re done! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways \n\n\n\nPET, also known as PETE or plastic #1, is what most plastic drink bottles are made from, and it makes up more than 10% of global plastic production.To recycle PET plastic, all you need to do is collect, filter, sort, rinse, and recycle your PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging.PET plastic can be recycled curbside, in a local recycling center, or in a bottle bill depot in countries and states with container deposit laws. \n\n\n\n\n PET Recycling: Five-Step Process / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways \n\n\n\nPET, also known as PETE or plastic #1, is what most plastic drink bottles are made from, and it makes up more than 10% of global plastic production.To recycle PET plastic, all you need to do is collect, filter, sort, rinse, and recycle your PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging.PET plastic can be recycled curbside, in a local recycling center, or in a bottle bill depot in countries and states with container deposit laws. \n\n\n\n\n PET Recycling: Five-Step Process / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways \n\n\n\nPET, also known as PETE or plastic #1, is what most plastic drink bottles are made from, and it makes up more than 10% of global plastic production.To recycle PET plastic, all you need to do is collect, filter, sort, rinse, and recycle your PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging.PET plastic can be recycled curbside, in a local recycling center, or in a bottle bill depot in countries and states with container deposit laws. \n\n\n\n\n PET Recycling: Five-Step Process / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways \n\n\n\nKey takeaways \n\n\n\nPET, also known as PETE or plastic #1, is what most plastic drink bottles are made from, and it makes up more than 10% of global plastic production.To recycle PET plastic, all you need to do is collect, filter, sort, rinse, and recycle your PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging.PET plastic can be recycled curbside, in a local recycling center, or in a bottle bill depot in countries and states with container deposit laws. \n\n\n\nPET, also known as PETE or plastic #1, is what most plastic drink bottles are made from, and it makes up more than 10% of global plastic production.To recycle PET plastic, all you need to do is collect, filter, sort, rinse, and recycle your PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging.PET plastic can be recycled curbside, in a local recycling center, or in a bottle bill depot in countries and states with container deposit laws. \n\n- PET, also known as PETE or plastic #1, is what most plastic drink bottles are made from, and it makes up more than 10% of global plastic production.\n- To recycle PET plastic, all you need to do is collect, filter, sort, rinse, and recycle your PET plastic bottles, containers, and packaging.\n- PET plastic can be recycled curbside, in a local recycling center, or in a bottle bill depot in countries and states with container deposit laws.\n\n\n\n\n PET Recycling: Five-Step Process / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PET Recycling: Five-Step Process / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to a section:What is PET (Plastic #1)?Is PET (Plastic #1) recyclable?Where can you recycle PET (Plastic #1)?How to recycle PET (Plastic #1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is PET (Plastic #1)? \n\n\n\nPET, short for polyethylene terephthalate, is a durable, clear, non-reactive, and lightweight plastic.

To get started, get\u00a0some recycling containers. That\u2019s it. Ideally, at least two: one for curbside recyclable plastics (PET, HDPE, and PP) and another for non-recyclable plastics (PVC, LDPE, PS, and All Other Plastics).Plastic items made from PET include:Water and soda bottlesFood containersJarsMicrowave traysIn addition to the items on the list above, any other plastic items with the #1 recycling symbol are made of PET.Here\u2019s what the PET recycling symbol looks like: \n\n\n\n\n PET (Plastic #1) Recycling Symbol / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\nRecycling regularly will eventually grant you the superpower of identifying PET plastic quickly without having to look up the symbol. Initially, though, it will be easier for you to collect all plastic, regardless of type. Then, you can identify the PET plastic in the filtering and sorting phase. In any case, it\u2019s best practice to recycle all possible types of plastic, not just PET. \n\n\n\nSort out the non-recyclable plastic. \n\n\n\nOnce you have collected enough plastic around your home, it\u2019s time to move on to the filtering phase. This is where you identify the different types of plastic and separate them into distinct groups. The most straightforward way to do this is by using the recycling symbol (the resin identification code) on each plastic item and sorting them accordingly.\nThe different types of plastic are listed below:\n\nPET (Plastic #1): Curbside recyclable\nHDPE (Plastic #2): Curbside recyclable\nPVC (Plastic #3): Not curbside recyclable\nLDPE (Plastic #4): Not curbside recyclable\nPP (Plastic #5): Curbside recyclable\nPS (Plastic #6): Not curbside recyclable\nPlastic #7 (All Other Plastics): Not curbside recyclable\n\nBased on this list, filter the plastics into two groups: curbside recyclable (plastics #1, #2, and #5), and not curbside recyclable (plastics #3, #4, #6, and #7). The first group will be easy to recycle curbside, while the second group will require more effort. That is why it\u2019s important to group them separately.\nIf you have a container deposit law in your state or country, consider creating a third sorting group for PET bottles. This will allow you to quickly take all bottles to a bottle refund depot and recycle them in one go. \n\n\n\nRinse and clean any leftover food or dirt. \n\n\n\nOnce you have determined which plastics are recyclable, it\u2019s time to give them a quick rinse to ensure that they get processed by the recycling center. Remember to use water conservatively to avoid contributing to\u00a0water scarcity. The plastics don\u2019t need to be squeaky clean. Empty the container, give it a quick rinse, and that should do the trick. \n\n\n\nDrop off your PET bottles at a depot. \n\n\n\nNow\u2019s the time to take your PET bottles to a bottle refund depot to get some cash back while also helping the environment. However, if there are no deposit refund laws in your state or country, you will have to skip this step and recycle the PET bottles with your other recyclable plastics.If you\u2019re unsure about container deposit legislation in your country, have a look at these two resources, which give a country-by-country, state-by-state overview of container deposit schemes around the world:\u201cContainer-deposit legislation\u201d by Wikipedia\u201cGlobal Deposit Book\u201d by the Reloop PlatformContainer deposit legislation is one of the most effective ways of increasing PET recycling rates.

The most straightforward way to do this is by using the recycling symbol (the resin identification code) on each plastic item and sorting them accordingly.\n\nThe different types of plastic are listed below:\n\n- PET (Plastic #1): Curbside recyclable\n- HDPE (Plastic #2): Curbside recyclable\n- PVC (Plastic #3): Not curbside recyclable\n- LDPE (Plastic #4): Not curbside recyclable\n- PP (Plastic #5): Curbside recyclable\n- PS (Plastic #6): Not curbside recyclable\n- Plastic #7 (All Other Plastics): Not curbside recyclable\n\nBased on this list, filter the plastics into two groups: curbside recyclable (plastics #1, #2, and #5), and not curbside recyclable (plastics #3, #4, #6, and #7). The first group will be easy to recycle curbside, while the second group will require more effort. That is why it\u2019s important to group them separately.\n\nIf you have a container deposit law in your state or country, consider creating a third sorting group for PET bottles. This will allow you to quickly take all bottles to a bottle refund depot and recycle them in one go.\n\n\n\nRinse and clean any leftover food or dirt. \n\n\n\nRinse and clean any leftover food or dirt. \n\n\n\nOnce you have determined which plastics are recyclable, it\u2019s time to give them a quick rinse to ensure that they get processed by the recycling center. Remember to use water conservatively to avoid contributing to\u00a0water scarcity. The plastics don\u2019t need to be squeaky clean. Empty the container, give it a quick rinse, and that should do the trick. \n\n\n\nOnce you have determined which plastics are recyclable, it\u2019s time to give them a quick rinse to ensure that they get processed by the recycling center.

To get started, get\u00a0some recycling containers. That\u2019s it. Ideally, at least two: one for curbside recyclable plastics (PET, HDPE, and PP) and another for non-recyclable plastics (PVC, LDPE, PS, and All Other Plastics).Plastic items made from PET include:Water and soda bottlesFood containersJarsMicrowave traysIn addition to the items on the list above, any other plastic items with the #1 recycling symbol are made of PET.Here\u2019s what the PET recycling symbol looks like: \n\n\n\n\n PET (Plastic #1) Recycling Symbol / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\nRecycling regularly will eventually grant you the superpower of identifying PET plastic quickly without having to look up the symbol. Initially, though, it will be easier for you to collect all plastic, regardless of type. Then, you can identify the PET plastic in the filtering and sorting phase. In any case, it\u2019s best practice to recycle all possible types of plastic, not just PET. \n\n\n\nSort out the non-recyclable plastic. \n\n\n\nOnce you have collected enough plastic around your home, it\u2019s time to move on to the filtering phase. This is where you identify the different types of plastic and separate them into distinct groups. The most straightforward way to do this is by using the recycling symbol (the resin identification code) on each plastic item and sorting them accordingly.\nThe different types of plastic are listed below:\n\nPET (Plastic #1): Curbside recyclable\nHDPE (Plastic #2): Curbside recyclable\nPVC (Plastic #3): Not curbside recyclable\nLDPE (Plastic #4): Not curbside recyclable\nPP (Plastic #5): Curbside recyclable\nPS (Plastic #6): Not curbside recyclable\nPlastic #7 (All Other Plastics): Not curbside recyclable\n\nBased on this list, filter the plastics into two groups: curbside recyclable (plastics #1, #2, and #5), and not curbside recyclable (plastics #3, #4, #6, and #7). The first group will be easy to recycle curbside, while the second group will require more effort. That is why it\u2019s important to group them separately.\nIf you have a container deposit law in your state or country, consider creating a third sorting group for PET bottles. This will allow you to quickly take all bottles to a bottle refund depot and recycle them in one go. \n\n\n\nRinse and clean any leftover food or dirt. \n\n\n\nOnce you have determined which plastics are recyclable, it\u2019s time to give them a quick rinse to ensure that they get processed by the recycling center. Remember to use water conservatively to avoid contributing to\u00a0water scarcity. The plastics don\u2019t need to be squeaky clean. Empty the container, give it a quick rinse, and that should do the trick. \n\n\n\nDrop off your PET bottles at a depot. \n\n\n\nNow\u2019s the time to take your PET bottles to a bottle refund depot to get some cash back while also helping the environment. However, if there are no deposit refund laws in your state or country, you will have to skip this step and recycle the PET bottles with your other recyclable plastics.If you\u2019re unsure about container deposit legislation in your country, have a look at these two resources, which give a country-by-country, state-by-state overview of container deposit schemes around the world:\u201cContainer-deposit legislation\u201d by Wikipedia\u201cGlobal Deposit Book\u201d by the Reloop PlatformContainer deposit legislation is one of the most effective ways of increasing PET recycling rates.

It\u2019s a very widely-used type of plastic and because of that has a relatively big environmental footprint. But there are many things you can do to minimize your use and ensure you properly recycle these plastics. Let\u2019s get started. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental facts about plastic #2 \n\n\n\nThe eco-footprint of HDPE plastic is pretty similar to other types of plastic, but here are a few #2 plastic specific stats to give you an idea of its impact on the world:Aliases:\u00a0This plastic has several names, including high density polyethylene, HDPE, and plastic #2.Pollution:\u00a0Like all other plastics, manufacturing HDPE\u00a0produces air pollution (including carbon dioxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and sulfur oxides), water pollution (like acids, ammonia, chromium, dissolved and suspended solids, and iron), and solid waste (such as coal ash and other particulates from burning fuel).Decomposition:\u00a0The average plastic bag can take up to\u00a01,000 years\u00a0to dissolve in the environment, and Americans use approximately\u00a0200 billion every year.\u00a0Worldwide, humans use\u00a05 trillion\u00a0plastic bags annually.Landfill space:\u00a0Recycling one HDPE plastic bottle out of ten in America would save\u00a0200 million pounds\u00a0of plastic from going to the dump. Unfortunately, because of its lightweight nature, #2 plastic often blows away from landfills and ends up in the wild \u2013 forests, oceans, and other natural landscapes \u2013 where it can harm animals and create an unsightly mess.Recycling rates:\u00a0Unfortunately, only\u00a05%\u00a0of all plastics are recycled in the US, though the numbers for HDPE plastics is somewhat higher. About\u00a029.3%\u00a0of HDPE milk jugs and water bottles are recycled and only\u00a01-3%\u00a0of all plastic bags make it to recycling facilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere you find plastic #2 in your home \n\n\n\nThis is another very popular type of plastic that you will find all over your house \u2013 from the kitchen to the bathroom to the utility room to the backyard. Check out how versatile HDPE plastic is:Beverage containers \u2013 milk, water, juiceCereal box linersCleaning product containers \u2013 laundry detergent, all purpose cleanersCosmetic containers \u2013 shampoo, conditioner, facial washPipe and conduitShipping containersThin film plastic shopping bagsWire and cable coverings.Wood composites \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDPE recycling into new products \n\n\n\nUsing recycling postconsumer HDPE plastic to make new products is preferable to making products from raw resources. It saves landfill space, energy, water, resources, and reduces pollution. Consider, for instance,\u00a0recycling HDPE plastic bags\u00a0\u2013 making new bags from post-consumer content uses 67% less energy, 90% less water, and produces 33% fewer sulfur dioxide emissions, 50% fewer nitrous oxide emissions, and 87% fewer carbon dioxide emissions.\u00a0These are just a few of the products that can be made from recycling HDPE:CratesFilm plastic and sheetingFloor tilesGardening tools, flower pots, and hardscape materials (edging, etc)Non-food bottles \u2013 shampoo, conditioner, cleaning products, laundry cleaners, motor oil, antifreezePipePlastic lumber \u2013 used for playgrounds, outdoor patios, picnic tables, etc.Recycling bins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to recycle plastic #2 \n\n\n\nTurning your used HDPE 2 plastic products into new things starts by you recycling your old products. Follow these steps to ensure your plastic #2 waste goes to the right place:Reduce your use:\u00a0The easiest way to reduce your consumption of HDPE plastic is to consume less of it in the first place! Do this by carrying reusable shopping bags with you on every outing so that you don\u2019t have to choose between paper or plastic.Curbside recycling:\u00a0Many curbside recycling programs accept HDPE plastic bags for recycling \u2013 just ask before you include it in your bin and then be sure to keep them from blowing away by securing them in the bin on recycle day. Milk jugs, water bottles, cleaning and cosmetic containers, and other commonly used plastics with a #2 on the bottom should also be eligible for curbside recycling.Grocery store drop-off:\u00a0In the event that your curbside program doesn\u2019t accept plastic bags, try this option. Most supermarkets will accept plastic bags (theirs and other brands) for recycling. Check your local grocery store for bins assigned for this purpose. Then make sure you put \u201crecycle plastic bags\u201d on your grocery list so that you remember to return them on your next trip. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling HDPE (Plastic #2) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling HDPE (Plastic #2) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling HDPE (Plastic #2) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling HDPE (Plastic #2) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling HDPE (Plastic #2) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve likely used high-density polyethylene plastic (HDPE) during the course of this very day \u2013 that durable, strong plastic used to make one-use plastic bags, drink containers, shampoo bottles, and stretchy plastic.

Given their widespread use and relative toxicity, they are often termed the \u201cpoison plastic\u201d in the world of plastic products. Read on to learn more and find out how to protect yourself from this harmful type of plastic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental facts about plastic #3 \n\n\n\nPerhaps the most toxic plastic around, PVC plastics have a big impact on the environment and your health. These are the PVC facts:Aliases:\u00a0Other than the \u201cpoison plastic,\u201d this type goes by several names including polyvinyl chloride, PVC, vinyl, plastic #3.Consumption rates:\u00a0PVC plastic is the fifth most common plastic type used in the US bottle market, with a 0.3% market share (behind PET, HDPE, PP, and LDPE plastic). More than 7 billion pounds of the stuff is thrown away every year in America and in the UK, 18.6% of it gets recycled. Worldwide there is over 300 billion pounds of PVC in use (having been installed 30 or 40 years ago in buildings) which will soon reach the end of its life and requiring disposal.Human health:\u00a0Dioxins are the biggest problem with PVC. Dioxins are created as a byproduct of the manufacturing of PVC which is composed partly of chlorine. Dioxins, which are now ubiquitous in our food supply, are highly toxic, leading to developmental and reproductive disease, immune system damage, and cancer.Pollution:\u00a0Making PVC requires toxic chemicals such as\u00a0vinyl chloride monomer\u00a0(VCM),\u00a0ethylene dichloride (EDC), and other pollutants that poison surface water, ground water, and air.Disposal:\u00a0Because it is difficult to recycle, PVC is often burned in incinerators, but because it contains chlorine, this process creates more dioxin, which then is emitted into the atmosphere and waterways.\u00a0Medical waste incinerators, backyard burn barrels, secondary copper smelters, and municipal solid waste incinerators account for\u00a080% of all dioxin emissions\u00a0to air. Disposing of PVC into landfills results in dioxin poisoning of landfills and groundwater. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere you\u2019ll find plastic #3 in your home \n\n\n\nBy and large, any flexible, durable plastics products are likely to be made with PVC. Vinyl takes on many forms, and can be found in a wide range of consumer goods, including:Baby dishes and utensilsBags for textiles (bedding)Blister packs and clamshells containersDeckingFaux leather products \u2013 shoes, handbags, briefcasesFood shrink wrapMedical equipment \u2013 tubes, blood bagsPipeToysVinyl flooringVinyl sidingWindow framesWire insulation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs recycling PVC plastic possible? \n\n\n\nPVC is very difficult to recycle, and as a result very little of it is actually collected and processed in recycling facilities. Made from many different formulations composed of various additives, PVC products cannot easily be separated for recycling, which makes breaking vinyl products down into their original components nearly impossible. When it is recycled, it is made into inferior, lower quality products, such as the following:BindersCablesCarpet backingDecking and fencingFilm plasticFlooring \u2013 mats, tiles, resilient flooringPark benchesPipeSpeed bumps and traffic conesTo further complicate matters, when a single PVC bottle is combined with a batch of 100,000 recycled non-chlorinated bottles, the entire batch is contaminated and unusable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for PVC recycling \n\n\n\nBecause the risk of contaminating a good batch of recyclable plastics (like PETE or HDPE) with PVC is very high, you definitely need to check with your curbside recycling collection office or recycling drop-off center to confirm whether or not they accept PVC for recycling before you include with your other plastics. If it is not recyclable in your area, then follow these steps to reduce the amount of PVC you consume and send to the landfill:Precycle\u00a0PVC by limiting your consumption of it. Avoid flexible plastics, stay away from products with plastic #3 symbols on them, and look for home renovation products that are vinyl-free.Reuse\u00a0any PVC products you may have \u2013 whether it\u2019s an old faux leather handbag or vinyl flooring. Keep it in use as long as possible, and when you no longer have use for it, find someone else to sell it to or donate it to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling PVC (Plastic #3) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling PVC (Plastic #3) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling PVC (Plastic #3) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling PVC (Plastic #3) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling PVC (Plastic #3) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPolyvinyl chloride or PVC plastics are everywhere, and you\u2019re not likely to be happy about how they can harm your health and the planet.

Just check with your recycling program office to ensure that this is true. Some, however, will accept things like milk cartons and food container lids, but they will not accept LDPE plastic bags so be sure to clarify when talking to them.\nGrocery store drop-off programs:\u00a0Some supermarkets, including\u00a0Safeway\u00a0and\u00a0Lucky Food Centers\u00a0in the US and Canada, accept LDPE plastic bags for recycling. Check with your local grocery store to see if they have a program in your area.\nReuse:\u00a0In many cases, you can reuse old plastic food containers to store more food, use for kids drafts, store office supplies, and so on. If you can\u2019t recycle these plastics using either method above, look for way to use it around your home so that you don\u2019t send them to the landfill.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling LDPE (Plastic #4) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling LDPE (Plastic #4) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling LDPE (Plastic #4) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling LDPE (Plastic #4) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling LDPE (Plastic #4) / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAnother everyday plastic, low-density polyethylene plastic, or LDPE, is the kind of transparent plastic you\u2019ll find in things like shrink wrap, produce bags, and squeezable ketchup bottles.

With a high melting point, PP plastics are also great at preventing moisture transmission and are virtually inert in the face of things like acids and solvents. As such, you\u2019ll find them used for food containers, medical tools, and automotive parts. Though perhaps less common than PETE or HDPE plastics, knowing how to recycle these PP plastics is no less important. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental facts about plastic #5 \n\n\n\nAs with any plastic, there are environmental hazards related to both the manufacturing and disposal of products made with PP plastics:Aliases:\u00a0Goes by polypropylene or PP.Consumption rates:\u00a0PP plastics in the US make up\u00a01.8%\u00a0of the plastic bottle market, making it the third most common type used for bottles (behind PET and HDPE plastics).Pollution:\u00a0When PP plastic is heated, it can form chemicals with unknown toxicity similar to\u00a0BHT\u00a0and\u00a0BHA, raising concerns about pollution and human health. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is PP plastic and where will you find it in your home? \n\n\n\nThough not quite as widely used in everyday life as HDPE or LDPE plastics, plastic #5 can be found in many hidden products used in many regular routines:Automotive partsBottle capsCarpetingFood containers \u2013 yogurt, deli foods, margarine, ketchup, syrupMedicine bottles and containersMicrowaveable meal trays \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat plastic #5 products are recycled into \n\n\n\nWhat to know what plastic #5 becomes after it\u2019s recycled?

If you can determine its component parts and they fit within plastic resin categories 1 through 6, follow those recycling instructions. Otherwise, here are a few pointers:Bio-based plastics:\u00a0Known as polyactic acid (PLA) plastic, bio-based plastics should be sent to commercial composting facilities (they generally cannot be composted in your backyard compost bin or vermicompost bin). Do not mix them with other types of plastics in your recycling bin as they can be mistaken for things like HDPE or LDPE and go on to contaminate recycling batches.Curbside recycling:\u00a0In some instances, your curbside recycling program will accept #7 plastic items if there\u2019s a way to identify for certain that they are #7 plastics. Check with your solid waste management office or recycling office to find out what their policy is. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling Plastic #7 / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling Plastic #7 / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling Plastic #7 / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling Plastic #7 / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recycling Plastic #7 / Sander Tamm / Ecolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIf it looks nothing like resin numbers 1-6, then you may have a mystery plastic #7 on your hands.

Otherwise, here are a few pointers:\n\n- Bio-based plastics:\u00a0Known as polyactic acid (PLA) plastic, bio-based plastics should be sent to commercial composting facilities (they generally cannot be composted in your backyard compost bin or vermicompost bin). Do not mix them with other types of plastics in your recycling bin as they can be mistaken for things like HDPE or LDPE and go on to contaminate recycling batches.\n- Curbside recycling:\u00a0In some instances, your curbside recycling program will accept #7 plastic items if there\u2019s a way to identify for certain that they are #7 plastics. Check with your solid waste management office or recycling office to find out what their policy is.\n\n"

Namun, plastik juga menjadi masalah yang signifikan bagi lingkungan, karena sampah plastik dapat mengancam kehidupan makhluk hidup dan membutuhkan ratusan tahun untuk terurai, bahkan untuk sebagian jenis plastik sama sekali tidak bisa hilang dari muka bumi. Terlebih seperti kalian tahu bahwa sebagian besar plastik yang ada saat ini berasal dari minyak bumi, dimana merupakan sumber daya yang tidak dapat diperbaharui.\nDi tulisan kali ini, kami ingin sedikit membahas langkah-langkah daur ulang plastik yang biasa digunakan.

Resizing\nSampah plastik yang sudah di sortir dan dicuci, kemudian dipotong menjadi serpihan-serpihan kecil. Hal ini akan membantu memudahkan proses pembentukan dan menjadi kesempatan kembali untuk dibersihkan agar tidak tercampur dengan bahan non-plastik.\n5. Pemilahan Plastik\nSetelah proses resizing, langkah selanjutnya yaitu pemilahan plastik. Pada saat pemilihan, serpihan-serpihan plastik diuji untuk menentukan kualitasnya.\nKualitas pertama yang diuji yaitu kepadatan serpihan plastik. Pengujian seperti ini dilakukan dengan memasukkan serpihan-serpihan plastik ke dalam wadah besar berisi air. Partikel yang kurang padat akan mengapung, sementara partikel yang lebih padat akan tenggelam.\nPengujian selanjutnya yaitu air classification (penggolong udara), yaitu proses untuk mengukur seberapa besar atau kecil sebuah partikel dengan memasukkan material ke dalam ruang berisikan udara untuk disortir.\nPengujian ini dilakukan dengan menjatuhkan partikel plastik ke dalam ruang yang berisi udara. Partikel yang lebih kecil akan terbang ke atas, sedangkan partikel yang lebih besar akan terbang rendah ke bawah.\n6. Penggabungan\nLangkah terakhir dalam proses daur ulang sampah plastik yaitu penggabungan, dimana serpihan-serpihan plastik dihancurkan dan dilebur menjadi pelet plastik. Kemudian, pelet plastik tersebut diangkut ke perusahaan manufaktur plastik dan siap digunakan kembali untuk memproduksi produk bermanfaat lainnya.\nItulah 6 tahapan yang biasa dilakukan untuk proses daur ulang sampah. Panjang dan tidak mudah.. Belum lagi karbon emisi yang dihasilkan. Beberapa produk memang sedikit sulit dicari alternatif single use plastic nya, namun banyak juga yang ada alternatifnya.

Seperti kampanye #CeritaDaurUlang yang kami launch tahun ini, tulisan ini bukan untuk mendukung proses daur ulang begitu saja, namun untuk membuat kita semakin aware bahwa proses daur ulang adalah proses yang panjang yang memerlukan banyak energi sehingga jalan terbaik adalah MENCEGAH semaksimal mungkin.\n\n\n\n\nProses Daur Ulang Plastik\nSecara umum, ada 6 langkah daur ulang plastik yang biasa digunakan.\n1. Koleksi\nLangkah pertama dalam proses daur ulang sampah yaitu mengumpulkan material atau plastik yang akan didaur ulang. Di saat ini lah para pelaku daur ulang mengumpulkan sisa konsumsi plastik dari rumah tangga maupun industri untuk mereka jadikan satu. Maka dari itu kemudahan dan keefektifan proses ini dan proses setelah ini sangat bergantung dengan bagaimana kita memilih dan memilah sampah dari rumah.\n2. Sortir\nSetelah sampah plastik dikumpulkan, pelaku daur ulang akan menyortir dengan lebih detail berdasarkan beberapa item, mulai dari jenis plastik (bahan pembuatan), warna plastik, kandungan resin, atau bahkan cara pembuatannya. Proses ini menjadi salah satu bagian penting karena jenis plastik yang berbeda harus diproses dengan cara yang berbeda pula.\nMungkin memilah secara detail seperti itu menantang untuk kita lakukan dari rumah, namun tidak ada salahnya untuk menambah pengetahuan dan siapa tahu dapat mempraktekkannya juga sehingga meringankan beban pelaku daur ulang.\nBaca juga: 7 Simbol dan Jenis Plastik yang Perlu Kamu Ketahui\n3. Pencucian\nPencucian sampah bertujuan untuk menghilangkan sisa kotoran dan segala sesuatu yang tidak terbuat dari plastik. Sebagian besar kemasan plastik memiliki label, perekat, atau bahkan sisa makanan yang tidak dapat didaur ulang.\n4. Resizing\nSampah plastik yang sudah di sortir dan dicuci, kemudian dipotong menjadi serpihan-serpihan kecil. Hal ini akan membantu memudahkan proses pembentukan dan menjadi kesempatan kembali untuk dibersihkan agar tidak tercampur dengan bahan non-plastik.\n5. Pemilahan Plastik\nSetelah proses resizing, langkah selanjutnya yaitu pemilahan plastik. Pada saat pemilihan, serpihan-serpihan plastik diuji untuk menentukan kualitasnya.\nKualitas pertama yang diuji yaitu kepadatan serpihan plastik. Pengujian seperti ini dilakukan dengan memasukkan serpihan-serpihan plastik ke dalam wadah besar berisi air. Partikel yang kurang padat akan mengapung, sementara partikel yang lebih padat akan tenggelam.\nPengujian selanjutnya yaitu air classification (penggolong udara), yaitu proses untuk mengukur seberapa besar atau kecil sebuah partikel dengan memasukkan material ke dalam ruang berisikan udara untuk disortir.\nPengujian ini dilakukan dengan menjatuhkan partikel plastik ke dalam ruang yang berisi udara. Partikel yang lebih kecil akan terbang ke atas, sedangkan partikel yang lebih besar akan terbang rendah ke bawah.\n6. Penggabungan\nLangkah terakhir dalam proses daur ulang sampah plastik yaitu penggabungan, dimana serpihan-serpihan plastik dihancurkan dan dilebur menjadi pelet plastik. Kemudian, pelet plastik tersebut diangkut ke perusahaan manufaktur plastik dan siap digunakan kembali untuk memproduksi produk bermanfaat lainnya.\nItulah 6 tahapan yang biasa dilakukan untuk proses daur ulang sampah. Panjang dan tidak mudah.. Belum lagi karbon emisi yang dihasilkan. Beberapa produk memang sedikit sulit dicari alternatif single use plastic nya, namun banyak juga yang ada alternatifnya. Kita harus kritis dan terus bertanya, pilihan apa yang terbaik. Ingat bahwa DAUR ULANG adalah JALAN TERAKHIR dari PIRAMIDA 6R dari konsep Zero Waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nMengingat plastik menjadi salah satu masalah yang signifikan bagi lingkungan dan dapat mengancam kehidupan makhluk hidup dan membutuhkan ratusan tahun untuk terurai, itulah 6 tahapan proses daur ulang plastik bisa kita lakukan. 6 tahapan ini juga sebagai aksi bentuk peduli kita terhadap lingkungan.

                "content": "\n\n\nSeperti yang kita ketahui, plastik menjadi hal yang tidak bisa dipisahkan dari kehidupan kita. Namun, plastik juga menjadi masalah yang signifikan bagi lingkungan, karena sampah plastik dapat mengancam kehidupan makhluk hidup dan membutuhkan ratusan tahun untuk terurai, bahkan untuk sebagian jenis plastik sama sekali tidak bisa hilang dari muka bumi. Terlebih seperti kalian tahu bahwa sebagian besar plastik yang ada saat ini berasal dari minyak bumi, dimana merupakan sumber daya yang tidak dapat diperbaharui.\nDi tulisan kali ini, kami ingin sedikit membahas langkah-langkah daur ulang plastik yang biasa digunakan. Seperti kampanye #CeritaDaurUlang yang kami launch tahun ini, tulisan ini bukan untuk mendukung proses daur ulang begitu saja, namun untuk membuat kita semakin aware bahwa proses daur ulang adalah proses yang panjang yang memerlukan banyak energi sehingga jalan terbaik adalah MENCEGAH semaksimal mungkin.\n\n\n\n\nProses Daur Ulang Plastik\nSecara umum, ada 6 langkah daur ulang plastik yang biasa digunakan.\n1. Koleksi\nLangkah pertama dalam proses daur ulang sampah yaitu mengumpulkan material atau plastik yang akan didaur ulang. Di saat ini lah para pelaku daur ulang mengumpulkan sisa konsumsi plastik dari rumah tangga maupun industri untuk mereka jadikan satu. Maka dari itu kemudahan dan keefektifan proses ini dan proses setelah ini sangat bergantung dengan bagaimana kita memilih dan memilah sampah dari rumah.\n2. Sortir\nSetelah sampah plastik dikumpulkan, pelaku daur ulang akan menyortir dengan lebih detail berdasarkan beberapa item, mulai dari jenis plastik (bahan pembuatan), warna plastik, kandungan resin, atau bahkan cara pembuatannya. Proses ini menjadi salah satu bagian penting karena jenis plastik yang berbeda harus diproses dengan cara yang berbeda pula.\nMungkin memilah secara detail seperti itu menantang untuk kita lakukan dari rumah, namun tidak ada salahnya untuk menambah pengetahuan dan siapa tahu dapat mempraktekkannya juga sehingga meringankan beban pelaku daur ulang.\nBaca juga: 7 Simbol dan Jenis Plastik yang Perlu Kamu Ketahui\n3. Pencucian\nPencucian sampah bertujuan untuk menghilangkan sisa kotoran dan segala sesuatu yang tidak terbuat dari plastik. Sebagian besar kemasan plastik memiliki label, perekat, atau bahkan sisa makanan yang tidak dapat didaur ulang.\n4. Resizing\nSampah plastik yang sudah di sortir dan dicuci, kemudian dipotong menjadi serpihan-serpihan kecil. Hal ini akan membantu memudahkan proses pembentukan dan menjadi kesempatan kembali untuk dibersihkan agar tidak tercampur dengan bahan non-plastik.\n5. Pemilahan Plastik\nSetelah proses resizing, langkah selanjutnya yaitu pemilahan plastik. Pada saat pemilihan, serpihan-serpihan plastik diuji untuk menentukan kualitasnya.\nKualitas pertama yang diuji yaitu kepadatan serpihan plastik. Pengujian seperti ini dilakukan dengan memasukkan serpihan-serpihan plastik ke dalam wadah besar berisi air. Partikel yang kurang padat akan mengapung, sementara partikel yang lebih padat akan tenggelam.\nPengujian selanjutnya yaitu air classification (penggolong udara), yaitu proses untuk mengukur seberapa besar atau kecil sebuah partikel dengan memasukkan material ke dalam ruang berisikan udara untuk disortir.\nPengujian ini dilakukan dengan menjatuhkan partikel plastik ke dalam ruang yang berisi udara. Partikel yang lebih kecil akan terbang ke atas, sedangkan partikel yang lebih besar akan terbang rendah ke bawah.\n6. Penggabungan\nLangkah terakhir dalam proses daur ulang sampah plastik yaitu penggabungan, dimana serpihan-serpihan plastik dihancurkan dan dilebur menjadi pelet plastik. Kemudian, pelet plastik tersebut diangkut ke perusahaan manufaktur plastik dan siap digunakan kembali untuk memproduksi produk bermanfaat lainnya.\nItulah 6 tahapan yang biasa dilakukan untuk proses daur ulang sampah. Panjang dan tidak mudah.. Belum lagi karbon emisi yang dihasilkan. Beberapa produk memang sedikit sulit dicari alternatif single use plastic nya, namun banyak juga yang ada alternatifnya. Kita harus kritis dan terus bertanya, pilihan apa yang terbaik. Ingat bahwa DAUR ULANG adalah JALAN TERAKHIR dari PIRAMIDA 6R dari konsep Zero Waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nMengingat plastik menjadi salah satu masalah yang signifikan bagi lingkungan dan dapat mengancam kehidupan makhluk hidup dan membutuhkan ratusan tahun untuk terurai, itulah 6 tahapan proses daur ulang plastik bisa kita lakukan. 6 tahapan ini juga sebagai aksi bentuk peduli kita terhadap lingkungan.

Proses ini menjadi salah satu bagian penting karena jenis plastik yang berbeda harus diproses dengan cara yang berbeda pula.\nMungkin memilah secara detail seperti itu menantang untuk kita lakukan dari rumah, namun tidak ada salahnya untuk menambah pengetahuan dan siapa tahu dapat mempraktekkannya juga sehingga meringankan beban pelaku daur ulang.\nBaca juga: 7 Simbol dan Jenis Plastik yang Perlu Kamu Ketahui\n3. Pencucian\nPencucian sampah bertujuan untuk menghilangkan sisa kotoran dan segala sesuatu yang tidak terbuat dari plastik. Sebagian besar kemasan plastik memiliki label, perekat, atau bahkan sisa makanan yang tidak dapat didaur ulang.\n4. Resizing\nSampah plastik yang sudah di sortir dan dicuci, kemudian dipotong menjadi serpihan-serpihan kecil. Hal ini akan membantu memudahkan proses pembentukan dan menjadi kesempatan kembali untuk dibersihkan agar tidak tercampur dengan bahan non-plastik.\n5. Pemilahan Plastik\nSetelah proses resizing, langkah selanjutnya yaitu pemilahan plastik. Pada saat pemilihan, serpihan-serpihan plastik diuji untuk menentukan kualitasnya.\nKualitas pertama yang diuji yaitu kepadatan serpihan plastik. Pengujian seperti ini dilakukan dengan memasukkan serpihan-serpihan plastik ke dalam wadah besar berisi air. Partikel yang kurang padat akan mengapung, sementara partikel yang lebih padat akan tenggelam.\nPengujian selanjutnya yaitu air classification (penggolong udara), yaitu proses untuk mengukur seberapa besar atau kecil sebuah partikel dengan memasukkan material ke dalam ruang berisikan udara untuk disortir.\nPengujian ini dilakukan dengan menjatuhkan partikel plastik ke dalam ruang yang berisi udara. Partikel yang lebih kecil akan terbang ke atas, sedangkan partikel yang lebih besar akan terbang rendah ke bawah.\n6. Penggabungan\nLangkah terakhir dalam proses daur ulang sampah plastik yaitu penggabungan, dimana serpihan-serpihan plastik dihancurkan dan dilebur menjadi pelet plastik. Kemudian, pelet plastik tersebut diangkut ke perusahaan manufaktur plastik dan siap digunakan kembali untuk memproduksi produk bermanfaat lainnya.\nItulah 6 tahapan yang biasa dilakukan untuk proses daur ulang sampah. Panjang dan tidak mudah.. Belum lagi karbon emisi yang dihasilkan. Beberapa produk memang sedikit sulit dicari alternatif single use plastic nya, namun banyak juga yang ada alternatifnya. Kita harus kritis dan terus bertanya, pilihan apa yang terbaik. Ingat bahwa DAUR ULANG adalah JALAN TERAKHIR dari PIRAMIDA 6R dari konsep Zero Waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nProses Daur Ulang Plastik\nSecara umum, ada 6 langkah daur ulang plastik yang biasa digunakan.\n1. Koleksi\nLangkah pertama dalam proses daur ulang sampah yaitu mengumpulkan material atau plastik yang akan didaur ulang. Di saat ini lah para pelaku daur ulang mengumpulkan sisa konsumsi plastik dari rumah tangga maupun industri untuk mereka jadikan satu.
