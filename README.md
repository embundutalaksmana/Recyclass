Waste in Indonesia has been a big issue, especially plastic waste. Indonesia accounts for almost 7.8 million tons of plastic waste annually. It is estimated that 62.8% or 4.8 million tons remain unprocessed (World Bank, 2021). The rest of it goes straight to landfill, where waste is piled and disposed of in an environmentally-unfriendly manner. If we refer to data belonging to Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (KLHK), reported from the official website of Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional (SIPSN) that plastic waste has not decreased significantly and only stagnated around 16-18% annually. This needs to be followed up considering that plastic waste is very difficult to decompose and needs to be recycled in an organized manner. 

Based on this problem, that is the reason for us to make a plastic waste classification application called **RECYCLASS: Recycle Classification**. Using the CNN algorithm to classify plastic-type waste into 7 classes including PET (polyethylene terephthalate), HDPE (high-density polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PS (polystyrene), and others. We hope this will make it easier for people to manage plastic waste.
