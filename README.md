# Recyclass Application - overview
# Mobile Development Workflow
1. 

2. Design Implementation
At this stage, we start dividing the work by the features and the flow of the application. Each of us will implement the design into the application using the XML language. We chose XML because we feel more fluent in using it than other possible languages, we also think that the components for the UI/UX of this application are still relatively simple so they are still quite easy to implement using XML. Here are some sample code and implementation results.

To implement the animation, we use the motion layout.

3. Testing API
Whenever we get a new endpoint, we start to work on it from this stage. The first thing that we do was try the endpoint via Postman. After we were sure that it runs properly, we started to try to get the data on the application using the retrofit library, Gson converter, and okhttp3. We use Retrofit and Gson converter to ease the process of pulling the data from the network and to make it easier to convert JSON data received from endpoints into the data form that we can process in applications. We use the Okhhtp3 library to help us to see the endpoint calling process and the response that is given.
