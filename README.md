# Recyclass Application - overview
# Mobile Development Workflow
1. 

2. Design Implementation
At this stage, we start dividing the work by the features and the flow of the application. Each of us will implement the design into the application using the XML language. We chose XML because we feel more fluent in using it than other possible languages, we also think that the components for the UI/UX of this application are still relatively simple so they are still quite easy to implement using XML. Here are some sample code and implementation results.

To implement the animation, we use the motion layout.
